# HaSAPPy_GUI
Developing a GUI application for HaSAPPy

To run HaSAPPy_GUI find in the terminal the HaSAPPy_GUI folder that contains the HaSAPPy_GUI.py file.
In the terminal use the following command:
python HaSAPPy_GUI.py

The GUI supports the user in compiling the loadModule.txt file (requested to run an experiment in HaSAPPy). When sections of interest have been filled up, a new loadModule can be saved (Save function). HaSAPPy_GUI allows the user to load and modify a loadModule previously generated (Load function).
